I'm a PhD Candidate at [Curtin University](https://curtin.edu.au) under the supervision of Dr. Senjian An and Prof. Ling Li.
I'm also a machine learning engineer at [Phobos Consulting](https://phobos.com.au).
In my spare time you might spot me with the [Perth Thundercorps](https://www.facebook.com/perththundercorps).
